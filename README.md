# Programming Literacy and Economic Resilience Analysis
Programming Literacy (and economic resilience)

Description:
This repository contains the research and analysis code for the project investigating the correlation between programming literacy and economic resilience across different geographical regions. The project utilizes data from various sources including Stack Overflow and OECD to analyze programming literacy levels and their impact on economic resilience and growth. The datasets encompass information on programming activity, geographic locations, and economic indicators across different regions over time.

Here's a breakdown of the key components explored in this project:

Excess Programming Literacy Analysis:

Developing a measure for excess programming literacy over predictable programming literacy based on economic activity levels.
Geographic analysis of programming literacy using Stack Overflow data.
Economic Resilience and Growth Correlation:

Investigating the relationship between programming literacy and economic resilience/growth.
Descriptive Predictors of Programming Density:

Analyzing the variables that predict high programming density within regions.
Data Expansion:

Replicating data generation for new countries and different programming languages to broaden the analysis scope.
Resilience Measurement:

Attempting to measure target variables such as resilience to crisis and forward-looking growth, and testing their relationship with excess programming literacy.
The repository is structured with different Jupyter Notebooks for exploratory data analysis, data processing, and model development, alongside the datasets used for this analysis.
